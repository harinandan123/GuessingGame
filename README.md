## How can I run it?

Unfortunately, you cant run/play the game without installing python on your machine. You could install python on Windows 10 and also 11 by following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96OByGW3jpI) Python is default installed on most linux distros, if not open the Bash terminal in Linux and run:

```bash
sudo apt install python3
```
For installing python on mac, follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTNGi88XHjU)
